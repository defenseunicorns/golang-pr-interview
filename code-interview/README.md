## Golang Technical Interview

## Code Interview 

We value problem solving with others over code complexity or completeness.

It is the job of the interviewer to lead the interview in a way that 
will showcase that skillset of the candidate best - this could be by
increasing or lowering difficultly.

Interviewers will fork this repository and at the end of the interview the
candidate will push up code by creating a Pull Request against the forked
repository. 

Candidates will not be tested on their ability to add a remote, or push up
a pull request. It is the job of the interviewer to get the final code.
